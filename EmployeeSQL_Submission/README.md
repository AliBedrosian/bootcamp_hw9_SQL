# bootcamp_hw9_SQL
Alison McCondichie - Homework 9 - SQL

The purpose of this project was to evaluate a data base set of employees hired at a specific time frame at a business. 
The project called for data modeling: organizing tables with database diagrams, data engineering: making connections between tables with primary and foreign keys as well as correctly importing data into SQL from csv files, and data analysis: running queries in SQL to return the data that answers questions asked. 

I have provided SQL files for the data analysis and schemas portion of this project in addition to .png file of the database diagram and a .pdf of the data modeling documentation provided by QuickDBD.

I have screenshots all the results for each question query.
